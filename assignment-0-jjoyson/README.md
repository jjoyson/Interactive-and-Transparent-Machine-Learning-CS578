* Inform the instructor about your preferences.

## Instructions
(After following proper instructions for cloning the repo to your own machine)
Edit the this file and respond to the questions.
(Then, make sure to add, commit, and push. Feel free (and in fact, you are encouraged) to add/commit/push often. For example, add/commit/push every time you answer one more question.)

1. **I'm happy that you are taking this class. To address your interests better, may I know why you are taking this class?**
    I have previously taken ML which was theory heavy. I wanted some practical experience with ML models and transparency of the model is exactly what I am looking for.
2. **Have you taken CS584 - Machine Learning here at Illinois Tech?**
    Yes
3. **What's your favorite programming language? Why?**
    It used to be Java since it was the only programming language I had a class on but Python has become my favorite due to the various libraries, ease of use and platforms such as jupyter available for convenience.
4. **What's your favorite classifier? Why?**
    Decision Trees since it makes the most sense to me (very transparent). I am hoping to gain a better understanding in this class for other classifiers.
5. **Why do you think we need transparency and interaction for machine learning algorithms?**
    Most of these algorithms will only be used or applied in industries if the expert in the field knows what the algorithm does. With respect to the programmer, having a transparent and interactive algorithm will help build a better model (or choose another route). In the end, it makes both users and builders of these algorithms educated and better versed to the models the algorithms produce.
